## Details
Dependancies are hosted via cdn

All js/css is contained within the index.html for portability

## How it works
Resize your browser window to <1024 and the 3 columns will become a accordion panel

## Known behavior
If you resize your browser to trigger the accordion panel and then change your browser back to a desktop size the column body content will remain hidden. Just reload the page.
